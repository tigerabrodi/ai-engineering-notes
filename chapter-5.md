## Prompt Structure

The three-part structure the author describes is a classic approach:

1. Task description: Clearly explains what you want the model to do
2. Examples: Shows the model what good outputs look like
3. Actual task: The specific instance you want the model to handle

This structure helps guide the model by setting expectations upfront.

## Zero-Shot vs Few-Shot Learning

- **Zero-shot**: Asking the model to perform a task without examples
  - Example: "Translate this sentence to French: 'Hello, how are you?'"
- **Few-shot**: Providing examples before asking the model to perform a similar task
  - Example: "English: Hello | French: Bonjour
    English: Thank you | French: Merci
    English: How are you? | French: ?"

Few-shot learning often produces better results because you're demonstrating the exact pattern you want.

## Prompt Engineering Best Practices

- **Clear instructions**: Being explicit about what you want
- **Output format specification**: Telling the model exactly how to structure its response
- **Examples**: Demonstrating the expected pattern
- **Sufficient context**: Giving the model all information it needs to succeed

## Prompt Decomposition

This is about breaking complex tasks into simpler subtasks. Instead of asking the model to do everything at once, you:

1. Break the problem into smaller parts
2. Solve each part separately
3. Combine the results

For example, rather than asking a model to "analyze this financial report and create a summary with key metrics, trends, and recommendations," you might:

1. First ask it to extract key metrics
2. Then identify trends in those metrics
3. Finally generate recommendations based on the trends

This approach generally produces more reliable and accurate results, especially for complex tasks.
